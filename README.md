COM4043 COMPUTING SKILLS PORTFOLIO ASSESSMENT

TASK 1:
Web hosting is a way of storing your website online. There are typically two main types of servers, a shared server and a cloud-based server. A traditional shared web hosting server, like GoDaddy, is when clients have to share a physical server that is stored in a data centre which they must rent. A cloud-based hosting server, like AWS or Azure, is one that is based virtually and can be accessed by an unlimited number of people. There are many differences between the two hosting servers such as cost, scalability, ease of setup and maintenance and updates. 
Shared servers typically work out to be much cheaper than cloud-based servers. “GoDaddy Hosting Plans start at £3.99 a month up to £10.99 a month for a plan that handles up to 50 websites and 100 databases” (GoDaddy, 2024). Cloud based servers like Microsoft Azure are more expensive and have a pay-as-you-go style of payment starting from $14.60 per month which is the cheapest option (Microsoft, n.d.).
In terms of scalability for a bakery, shared web hosting is not the best option. They come with restricted resources such as storage, memory and processing power. As these are being shared with other websites, it can affect the activity of the bakery’s website. Therefore, it will be difficult to scale up to handle the oncoming traffic. In terms of cloud hosting, it is amazing to use for scalability. It can automatically create more space when there is high traffic on a website. 
Shared web hosting is much easier to set up than cloud hosting. This is because cloud hosting requires configuration to set up whereas shared web hosting only requires you to download something which is quick and easy to do. 
It is also easier to maintain shared web hosting than cloud. The reason for this is that cloud hosting requires the user to complete all updates and carry out any maintenance themselves. However, the provider of the shared hosting carries out all maintenance and updates which requires the user to do nothing. 
To conclude, the small bakery should start off with the traditional shared web hosting. This is because it works out to be much cheaper and requires the least amount of maintenance. Although it is not great for scalability, it is still much easier to start off with. Once the bakery begins to see a good amount pf growth, they should then consider cloud hosting as it is much better in terms of scalability.

TASK 3 SHORT DISCUSSION:
The histogram shows that we have a distribution that is quite symmetrical, if we were to put a line down the middle, both sides are pretty much the same as one another. The mean and median show that the distribution is symmetrical as the values are close to each other. Due to these reasons, there is not a skew that is very visible. In terms of the difference between my sample shape and a normal distribution, there is not a big difference. The reason my shape is not as neat as a normal distribution is that I have 1000 random numbers that have been generated whereas a normal distribution does not have that.

TASK 4 – ERRORS IN THE CODE:
1.	The first error is that there is no loop that makes sure the correct integer is being entered. If an integer less than 50 is being entered, then the loop should keep repeating itself until the correct integer has been entered. 
2.	The second error is in step 3 of the code. ‘Random.seed’ says ‘ssd’ instead of ‘s_d’.
3.	The code to compute the sum of data, mean and maximum data is missing
4.	The code for histogram is also missing.

TASK 4 – EXPLAINING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE CODE
•	Import random generates random numbers.
•	Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt is used to create figures and plot various elements for a graph.
•	myID = 2313846 stores my ID for future use in my code.
•	User input validation asks you to an enter an integer that is less than or equal to 50. A message is printed if the number is less than 50.
•	randSeednum converts each digit in myID into an integer and then calculates the sum of them all. The sum is then used as a random seed.
•	Random list creation creates a list of varCount random numbers  between 1 and 200.
•	Computing statistics finds the mean, the smallest and biggest number and the sum of all the numbers.
•	The results are then printed.
•	A histogram is then plotted, labels are added to the axis and the histogram is displayed.

TASK 5:
Over the last two semesters, there have been a few challenges I have faced. The main challenge has been the mathematics side of things this semester. The reason for this is that it has been a few years since I last did maths, so I have found it a little difficult to wrap my head around things and understand equations and how to translate them into python. In order to overcome this issue, I looked through the class notes on Moodle and also googled some equations to help me.
Last semester, we used visual studio code to create the front and back-end of an app. The part that I found the easiest was creating the front-end using HTML and CSS. This is because I am confident in using them both and find them the easiest programming language to use. However, I found it very difficult to create the back end. Although I had previously used python, it was in quite a basic format, whereas for this particular task I had to be more technical which is something I had not done before. In order to run the code, I had to use flask and also had to connect to MongoDB – which I did find slightly confusing and hard to grasp at first. To overcome these issues, I watched YouTube videos and looked through the GitHub notes that the lecturer put on Moodle. 
The next step for my own computing growth is to figure out how to overcome issues myself and not stress out. When completing my assignment last semester, my visual studio code stopped working and debugging which caused me to get very stressed. I immediately asked other for help rather than trying to fix it myself. In the future I would like to try and figure out and solve the problem by staying calm and then tackling the issue.
